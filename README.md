## About
* This is the matplotlib homework assignment for the GT Data Science Bootcamp. The challenge is to demonstrate the ability to import data and display it using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
* Within a Jupyter Notebook, data are extracted from the two [Data Sources](#datasources). 

## Procedure
* The data were extracted from the two files (see [Data Sources](#datasources)) and put into Pandas DataFrames which were then merged. 
* DataFrame.duplicated() was used to check for mice with duplicate data. 
  * There was one mouse with duplicate data (more than one data point per timestamp)
  * This mouse had conflicting data - different tumor sizes and metastatic sites for the same timestamp. Therefore, the mouse was deleted alltogether since there is no way to justify which data to use. 
* The .loc function was used to remove all instances of the duplicated mouse. 
  * There were 249 mice originally, now there are 248 mice in the DataFrame. 
  * There were 13 rows removed, even though there were only 10 rows with duplicate Mouse ID and Timepoint. 
* A summary table was created using df.groupby() and the .mean(), .median(), .var(), .std() and .sem() groupby object functions and pd.DataFrame(). A second summary table was created in one line using df.groupby() and the .agg() groupby object function. 
* Bar and pie charts were created using both Pandas and pyplot. 

## Data Sources
The data for this challenge can be found in the following two files:
/Data/Mouse_metadata.csv 
/Data/Study_results.csv
